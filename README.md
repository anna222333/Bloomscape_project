# BloomProject Documentation Hub

This repository tracks the documentation for the Bloomscape-like WooCommerce store.

## Key directories
- `docs/` — authoritative Markdown docs, following the Purpose/Scope/Procedure structure.
- `docs/STAGE_BRIEFS/` — per-stage briefings based on the project stage map.
- `docs/ADR/` — architecture decision records.

All documentation must remain English-only, evidence-driven, and reproducible on a fresh Ubuntu+Docker VM.
