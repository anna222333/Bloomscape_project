# Repository Metadata (GitHub About)

## Purpose

This document stores the authoritative repository metadata for GitHub:
- About description
- Website field (if any)
- Topics (tags)

Repository exports/snapshots (if stored): `docs/EXPORTS/`

This ensures repo metadata is not maintained "orally" and stays aligned with Git Source of Truth.
