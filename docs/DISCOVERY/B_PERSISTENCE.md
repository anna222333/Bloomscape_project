# Persistence Baseline (Stage B)

## Purpose

Outline data persistence assumptions (databases, backups, media storage) at the start of Discovery.

## What to capture
- database engine and version (MySQL/MariaDB/other),
- backup procedures or retention expectations,
- media / assets storage location and constraints.

## Evidence
- config snippets or commands that confirm the persistence stack.
- notes about required migrations or data ownership.

## Open questions
- What persistence trade-offs must the architecture consider?
