# Environment Baseline (Stage B)

## Purpose

Document the baseline environment (OS, PHP, web server, Docker/VM assumptions) that discovery inspected.

## What to capture
- current hosting or VM constraints,
- PHP and web server versions/configuration,
- relevant Docker/container settings or restrictions.

## Evidence
- note command outputs or config snippets that prove the baseline.
- reference `docs/EXPORTS/stage_a_foundation_artifacts_export.txt` if needed for earlier context.

## Questions
- Are there limitations that affect WooCommerce requirements?
