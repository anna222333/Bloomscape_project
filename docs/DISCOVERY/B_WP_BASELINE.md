# WordPress Baseline (Stage B)

## Purpose

Capture the baseline WordPress setup that discovery audits.

## What to capture
- active version of WordPress and multisite status,
- core plugins/themes with enabled states,
- essential configuration (site URL, debugging flags).

## Evidence
- output from `wp-cli` commands or config exports (URL, active theme list).
- notes on any required plugin upgrades or compatibility gaps.

## Follow-up
- Identify gaps that require ADRs or expanded requirements.
