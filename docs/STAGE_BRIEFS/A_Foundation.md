# STAGE BRIEF — A: Foundation

## Purpose
Establish the repository doc framework, templates, and change control rules so later stages share a single source of truth.

## Scope
- **In scope:** docs structure, templates, quality controls, Change Control primer.
- **Out of scope:** product implementation, UX/content decisions.

## Deliverables
- MASTER_PLAN.md, WORK_BREAKDOWN.md, RISK_REGISTER.md, QUALITY_GATES.md
- STAGE_BRIEFS skeletons and ADR template in docs/ADR/

## Definition of Done
- Files created and referenced in README.
- Template language and formatting are consistent.
- Stage B can start without oral handoff.

## Acceptance Tests
- AT-A1: MASTER_PLAN is readable and referenced in README.
- AT-A2: Scope boundaries and prohibitions are explicit.

## Dependencies
- None.

## Tasks
- A-01: Document structure overview.
- A-02: Create template files.
- A-03: Confirm change control guidance.

## Risks
- R-004: Scope creep due to unclear documentation ownership.

## Handoff
Stage Chat A receives docs/ links and the “SoT=Git” rule for ongoing work.
