# STAGE BRIEF — I: Handover & Runbook

## Purpose
Deliver the final handover package: runbook, acceptance report, backlog, and quality gates status.

## Scope
- **In scope:** final documentation and controls.
- **Out of scope:** further product tweaks.

## Deliverables

## Definition of Done
- Runbook covers operations and security.
- Acceptance tests documented and verified.
- Backlog/known issues recorded transparently.

## Acceptance Tests

- I-03: List backlog items.

## Risks
