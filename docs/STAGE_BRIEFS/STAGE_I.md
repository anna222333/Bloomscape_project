# STAGE I — CLOSURE

## 1. Stage Purpose

Formally close the project:
- finalize documentation,
- record outcomes and lessons learned,
- confirm scope completion and archival readiness.

## 2. Stage Position in Lifecycle

- Previous stage: Stage H — Release
- Next stage: N/A (final stage)

---

## 3. In-Scope

- Final documentation review and completeness checks.
- Lessons learned and retrospective documentation.
- Closure report and archival readiness.

---

## 4. Out-of-Scope (Explicit)

- New features or scope additions.
- Uncontrolled changes after release without ADR.
- Implementation work beyond closure documentation.
