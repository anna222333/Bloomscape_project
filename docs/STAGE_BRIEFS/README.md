# STAGE_BRIEFS — Naming Authority

## Rule
To avoid drift, **only one naming scheme is authoritative**.

### Authoritative scheme (current)
- `STAGE_A.md … STAGE_I.md` are **authoritative**.
- Any `A_Foundation.md … I_Handover_Runbook.md` files are **legacy/mirrors** and must not be edited (or should be removed in a controlled cleanup PR).

## Enforcement
- Stage Chats must update only the authoritative Stage Brief file for their stage.
- If a file rename/removal is needed, do it via a dedicated hygiene PR.
