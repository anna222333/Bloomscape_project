# QUALITY GATES

## Stage Brief Detail Rule
- Always store STAGE_BRIEFS/A…I in Git as skeletons (10–15 lines) that cover purpose, scope, deliverables, DoD, acceptance tests, dependencies, tasks, risks, and handoff.
- Full elaboration (subtasks, specific solutions, finalized acceptance tests, updated risks) happens only within the coordinating Stage Chat for that stage.
- Upon stage completion, the relevant Stage Chat updates:
  - its Stage Brief (from skeleton to full narrative),
  - linked artifacts such as WORK_BREAKDOWN.md and RISK_REGISTER.md,
  - and produces a report/summary as evidence.
- Master Planning Chat does not backfill implementation details into stage briefs or replace Stage Chats.
